# DragonInjector

Welcome! This project aims to build a Nintendo Switch payload injector in the form factor of a standard game cartridge, so that it can be stored inside the console for easy transportation. DragonInjector will include an RCM jig in the cap as well as the ability to charge via a Type C port or the Switch game cartridge slot.

The source files for DragonInjector will be posted here once the project is complete. This will include:

- The Eagle project file, schematic and board file.
- The 3D models in .STEP and .STL format.
- A bitmap version of the schematic.
- Ready-to-go gerbers.
- Full parts list.
